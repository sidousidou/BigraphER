JSON codec for bigraphical structures

big_json is a codec to encode and decode bigraphical structures such as bigraphs
and reaction rules to the JSON data format. The library provides a JSON
interface to the matching engine of the bigraph library. This is also exposed by
the big_match command line tool.
