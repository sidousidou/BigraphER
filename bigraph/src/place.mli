val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** Pretty printer. *)

val edges : m -> (int * int) list
(** Computes the representation of a boolean matrix as a list of edges. *)

val size : t -> int
(** Compute the number of edges in the DAG. *)

val parse : regions:int -> nodes:int -> sites:int -> string list -> t
(** [parse r n s lines] computes a place graph with [r] regions, [n] nodes
    and [s] sites. Each element in [lines] is a string in the same format of
    the output of {!val:to_string}.

    @raise Invalid_argument if the arguments do not specify a valid place
    graph. *)

val get_dot : t -> string * string * string * string
(** [get_dot p] returns three strings expressing place graph [p] in dot
    format. The first two elements encode regions and sites shapes, the third
    encodes the node ranks and the fourth represents the adjacency matrix. *)

val apply : Iso.t -> t -> t
(** Apply an isomorphism *)

val parse_placing : int list list -> int -> t
(** [parse_placing l r] returns the placing with [r] regions defined by list
    [l] in which each element is a site's parent set. *)

(** Compute the set of nodes with no parents. *)

(** {2 Elementary place graphs} *)

val elementary_id : int -> t
(** [elementary_id m] computes a place graph in the form of an identity of

    region containing [m] sites. *)

val elementary_split : int -> t
(** [elementary_split m] computes an elementary place graph formed by one
    site shared by [m] regions. *)

val one : t
(** [one] is the place graph formed by an idle region. *)

val elementary_sym : int -> int -> t

    between [m] and [n]. *)

val elementary_ion : t
(** An ion. *)

(** {2 Comparison} *)

val equal_placing : t -> t -> bool
(** [equal_placing a b] returns [true] if placings [a] and [b] are equal.
    Inputs are assumed to be valid placing. No check is performed. *)

val compare_placing : t -> t -> int
(** [compare_placing a b] compares placings [a] and [b]. *)

(** {2 Operations} *)

exception COMP_ERROR of (int * int)
(** Raised when a composition between two incompatible place graphs is
    attempted. The two integers are the number of sites and regions involved
    in the composition, respectively. *)

val tens : t -> t -> t
(** [tens p0 p1] returns the tensor product of place graphs [p0] and [p1]. *)

val tens_of_list : t list -> t

    otherwise. *)

val is_plc : t -> bool

    otherwise. *)

val is_mono : t -> bool
(** [is_mono p] is [true] if place graph [p] is monomorphic, [false]
    otherwise. A place graph is monomorphic if no two sites are siblings and
    no site is an orphan. *)

val is_epi : t -> bool
(** [is_epi p] is [true] if place graph [p] is epimorphic, [false] otherwise.
    A place graph is epimorphic if no region is idle and no two regions are
    partners. *)

val is_guard : t -> bool
(** [is_guard p] is [true] if place graph [p] is guarded, [false] otherwise.
    A place graph is guarded if no region has sites as children. *)

(** {2 Invariants} *)
val deg_regions : t -> int list
(** Out-degree of roots, in order. *)

(** [decomp t p i] computes the decomposition of target [t] given pattern [p]
    and node isomorphism [i] from [p] to [t]. Pattern [p] is assumed epi and
    mono. The result tuple [(c, id, d, iso_c, iso_d)] is formed by context
    [c], identity [id], parameter [d], and nodes in [c] and [d] expressed as
    rows of [t]. The decomposition is with respect to the minimal parameter *)

exception NOT_PRIME
(** Raised when a place graph cannot be decomposed into prime components. The
    first element is a set of shared nodes and the second a set of shared
    sites. *)

val prime_components : t -> (t * Iso.t) list
(** Compute the prime components ({e i.e.} place graphs with one region) of a
    place graph. The original node numbering is returned in the form of an
    isomorphism.

    @raise NOT_PRIME when some region is shared *)

val decomp_d : t -> int -> t * t * Iso.t * Iso.t
