BigraphER is an implementation of Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS)

It consists of:

- The command-line tool `bigrapher` which computes transition systems. It
  supports bigraphs with sharing, stochastic reaction rules, rule priorities,
  graphical output and predicate checking. Models can also be exported to
  probabilistic model checker PRISM.

- The library `bigraph` which provides APIs for the manipulation of BRSs,
  bigraphs and reaction rules.
