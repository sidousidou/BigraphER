Quick setup for EMACS
-------------------
Add opam emacs directory to your load-path by appending this to your .emacs:
  ;; Add opam emacs directory to the load-path
  (setq opam-share (substring (shell-command-to-string \"opam config var share 2> /dev/null\") 0 -1))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (concat opam-share \"/bigrapher\"))
  ;; Load big-mode
  (require 'big-mode)
"
  {success}
