This repository contains a collection of tools for writing and
anlysing Bigraph models. It contains:

1. *bigraph* - a library to programmaticaly manipulate bigraphs, reaction rules
  and Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS). It supports both bigraphs and bigraphs
  with sharing, probabilistic and stochastic reaction rules, rule priorities,
  rules with instantiation maps, parameterised controls, simulation, exhaustive
  state space exploration, export to probabilistic model checker [PRISM][prism],
  and predicate checking. It is based on an efficient matching engine based on
  SAT.

2. *bigrapher* - BigraphER is a command-line tool to compute the transition
   system of a BRS and export it to the stochastic model checker [PRISM](prism)
   or to graphical form.

3. *big_json* - Big_json is a codec to encode and decode bigraphical
  structures such as bigraphs and reaction rules to the [JSON](json) data
  format. The library provides a JSON interface to the matching engine of the
  *bigraph* library. This is also exposed by the `big_match` command line tool.

4. *minisat* - Minisat provides bindings to the [MiniSAT](minisat) SAT solver.

5. *minicard* - Minicard provides bindings to the [MiniCARD](minicard)
  cardinality solver.

### Building the Tools

The tools can be built using dune (min version 2) as follows:

```
dune build --profile=release
```

To install the tools to a local opam repository you can use:

```
dune install --profile=release
```
