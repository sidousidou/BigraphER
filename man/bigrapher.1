.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
BigraphER (Bigraph Evaluator & Rewriting) 
is an implementation of Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS) that
supports bigraphs with sharing, stochastic reaction rules, rule
priorities and BiLog predicate checking. The bigraph matching engine
is based on a SAT encoding of the subgraph isomorphism problem. A BRS
and its labelling function can be exported to text files in
.I tra
and
.I csl
format, respectively, and used in stochastich model checker PRISM 
(<http://www.prismmodelchecker.org>) to carry out quantitative
analysis.  The graphical representation of bigraphs is generated by
the automatic layout generator Graphviz (<http://www.graphviz.org>).
