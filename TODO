TO DO:

=================================================================================

[DONE] add priorities inside declarations of brs and sbrs
[ - ]  implement stochastic brs
[ - ]  check if is more efficient to pass to the brs engine a string list of 
       react ides and a function string -> react instead of react lists
[ - ]  add basic bilog with matching (keywords: true, false, pred)
[DONE] add * (composition) and + (tensor) and check precedence
[ - ]  add sorts
[ - ]  validate priorities: in sbrs only instantaneous rules can be reduced and
       no instantaneous rules in standard classes. In sbrs there is at least a
       standard class.
[ - ]  Implement Brs and Sbrs with a functor or a class.
[ - ]  Implement sparse matrices with different data-structures.
[ - ]  Bottlenecks identified bt gprof are matrix multiplication and the
       construction of list of pairs for the bijections in the place graph. 
[ - ]  Add assetions in the lib
[ - ]  Produce svg with classes for controls
[ - ]  Remove Matrix low-level operations from Place
