TO DO:

=================================================================================

[DONE] add priorities inside declarations of brs and sbrs
[ - ]  implement stochastic brs
[ - ]  check if is more efficient to pass to the brs engine a string list of 
       react ides and a function string -> react instead of react lists
[ - ]  add basic bilog with matching (keywords: true, false, pred)
[DONE] add * (composition) and + (tensor) and check precedence
[ - ]  add sorts
[ - ]  validate priorities: in sbrs only instantaneous rules can be reduced and
       no instantaneous rules in standard classes. In sbrs there is at least a
       standard class.
