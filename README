[![Build Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/540f670b21c97efdb898a046/badge?branchName=master)](https://app.shippable.com/projects/540f670b21c97efdb898a046/builds/latest)

BigraphER is an implementation of Robin Milner's Bigraphical Reactive System
(BRS) that supports bigraphs with sharing, stochastic reaction rules, rule
priorities and BiLog predicate checking. The bigraph matching engine is
based on the SAT encoding of a reduction to the subgraph isomorphism
problem. The labelled transition system of a BRS can be exported to a text
file in [PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org) to carry out quantitative
analysis. The graphical representation of bigraphs is generated by the
automatic layout generator [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org).

BigraphER constist of:

*  an OCaml library to manipulate bigraphs and reaction rules. The library
     is distributed as an ocamlfind package (named bigraph),
*  a command-line tool (called bigrapher) that provides efficient
   manipulation and simulation of BRS and stochastic BRS.
