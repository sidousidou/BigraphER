Library to manipulate bigraphs and Bigraphical Reactive Systems

bigraph is a library to programmaticaly manipulate bigraphs, reaction rules and
Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS). It supports both bigraphs and bigraphs with
sharing, probabilistic and stochastic reaction rules, rule priorities, rules
with instantiation maps, parameterised controls, simulation, exhaustive state
space exploration, export to probabilistic model checker PRISM, and predicate
checking. It is based on an efficient matching engine based on SAT.
